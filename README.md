# lab-agile-planning
The motivation of this project is to build up a standard workload for a website giving service to its users.
The workload is being distributed to imaginary members of imaginary departments from an imaginary company.
As the new issues increase, the operations will get more complex and will be recorded/tracked in the Kanban board.
