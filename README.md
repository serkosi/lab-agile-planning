The motivation of this project is to create an exemplary Kanban board including tasks for a website giving service to its users.

The workload is being distributed to imaginary members of imaginary departments from an imaginary company.

As the new issues increase, the operations will get more complex with the related tasks and they will be recorded/tracked in the Kanban board.
