# lab-agile-planning
The motivation of this project is to create an exemplary Kanban board scheduling given tasks for a website giving service to its users.

The tasks are created as issues introduced to the board and visit different stages such as Product Backlog, Sprint backlog, Review/QA, etc. The workload is being distributed to imaginary members of imaginary departments from an imaginary company.

As the new issues increase, the operations will get more complex with the related tasks and they will be recorded/tracked in the Kanban board.

The initial Sprint plan template is taken from the online course, Introduction to Agile Development and Scrum by IBM, accessible via https://www.coursera.org/learn/agile-development-and-scrum/

* Several issues were labeled with priority levels (P0-High, P1-Medium, P2-Low).
* A parent relation was assigned among two issues.
Those implementations will help team members to identify and focus on high priority tasks, improves overall project management and task completion rates. This update will also enhance the planning and execution capability.
